## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the Ola to  understand their customers better. It helps the company know if their customers are satisfied with their services. Through different ratings, they get to know their improvement area, & thus they can improve their services by identifying these area. It also lets them know the Cancellation reason, thus since by using this dashboard they have identified this problem, they can further work on factors responsible for these unwanted Cancellation.

Since, cancellation rate is  almost 25% they need to bring it down.
